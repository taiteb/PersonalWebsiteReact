I've always been around tech, and for a long time, I'd simply taken it for granted. My dad did data center management, so computers were always in the house. We had servers in our basement (we once lost **all of our** digital family photos that were stored on them after a corruption- lesson learned in having redundant backups). The first time I was taught shell commands in linux was in second grade, to use sudo apt-get install to put a freeware Mario Kart clone on my hand-me-down dell laptop. I learned inspect element tools in middle school to fake millions of followers on YouTube and to change headlines to make my friends laugh. I participated in hackathons in high school, learned python, and voraciously learned CAD in my engineering classes. 

My passion for art gradually took over, though, and tech went by the wayside. I pursued digital art on my iPad, bridging the gap between analog art and digital art with scans and composite photography to make the 'real' more precise and digital, and to make the digital more textured and real. I learned GarageBand in and out until I outgrew the utility of the program, then dove in on learning the full productive system Logic Pro X provided me. The workflow of components, plugins, effects, and signal chains stimulated both the systems/logical/process side of my brain *as well* as my creative side, and I still to this day practice both. 

It seems almost obvious to say so now, but the biggest breakthrough that happened to me over my FullStack Academy course was right at the start, realizing that web development could be fulfilling in both sides of my personality as well. I think what scared me off from tech earlier was worry about it being *too* dry and stale. I'm nobody to shy away from things most people would consider 'dry and stale', considering my affinity for learning about obsolete tech, watching engineering channels on youtube, and spending hours tweaking presets and plugins on Logic. Diving into full stack development and seeing the creative liberty that the modern developer has, with constant growth and innovation in the ways it allows us to communicate and express, was been an eye-opening experience for me. 

I'm a long time follower of [Zach Lieberman](https://www.instagram.com/zach.lieberman/), an incredible digital artist who makes complex, colorful, and geometric generative art using shaders in the OpenFrameworks architecture. Immersed in development, his art took on a whole new meaning to me- while I had lacked the tenacity at the time to dive head first into learning C++ for a boutique creative framework, generative art and the potential it illustrated grasped me. I looked into alternative platforms, and I discovered P5.js, an open source creative library for JavaScript, a language I was already learning for class! I dove head first into Daniel Shiffman's [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/) series, an invaluable starting point for getting the basics down. The first pass through I would follow an assignment to the tee, typing alongside as he narrated what he was doing, then on the second pass I would attempt to deconstruct the pieces and create a new program, or at least tweak the old one enough to make it into my own version. P5.js is still a hobby of mine, and is used in several sections of the site, including the banner.
