## About

I'm particularly interested in the ways technology enables to communicate and express farther than what's ever been able for people before. It is a revolution in human communication bigger than the printing press; each of us currently has our own personal printing press, often multiple of them (some small enough to fit in our pockets), and with these we can make infinite copies, reach every corner of the globe, and replicate or iterate on any other piece of press we come across. It is staggering what this enables us, especially if you as a user fully learn how to tweak, modify, and personalize the capabilities of what the device in your hands is able to do.  

I've always been around tech, and for a long time, I'd simply taken it for granted. My dad did data center management, so computers were always in and around the house. We had servers in our basement I remember being taught how to reboot, and my sister and I were given laptops at a very young age. The first time I was taught shell commands in linux was in second grade, to use sudo apt-get install to put a freeware Mario Kart clone on my hand-me-down dell laptop. For the longest time, though, I think I resisted going into the tech sector, partially because it felt like what was just expected of me.  

I didn't go straight into college, unlike many of my peers (and friends). I don't regret the time I wasn't in schooling, though; I worked many jobs in the interim, and large or small, I picked up a lot of valuable skills. I know how to lead a team, I'm a lot better at soft social skills that a workplace requires, I am cool under pressure, I'm solid at time management and I'm used to juggling many tasks at the same time. I do not believe I would be as prepared, leadership wise, as I am had I taken the traditional path and just gone straight into college.
