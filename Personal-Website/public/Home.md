### Welcome to my website! 

I'm a 25 year old full-stack web developer, having enrolled and (soon to be) graduated from FullStack academy, in partnership with Colorado State University. I appreciate your interest in my work, and I hope this serves as a showcase for my abilities. This site is built by me, from the ground up. 

For a more detailed bio, click the About tab above. Portfolio is where I've got my most substantial projects, and I'll be updating it as I continue to work. To get in touch, please fill out the Contact form above. Finally, Recent Projects contains smaller projects, mostly P5.js sketches I've been doing. 

### About the site
This site is built off React JS, deployed through Netlify. Most of the text portions are .md documents imported into React with `react-markdown`, to save time and pain with styling, save for the Recent section; in order to stay away from using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to be able to use iFrame units, it's worth the trade off to just keep the text simple. Aside from that, and some styling, things are fairly basic here. 

### Why do I need to use iFrame? To display my P5.JS projects! 
All the embedded visual elements, from the banner up above to the items in the Projects tab, are GitHub Sites-hosted sketches of mine using P5.JS, an extensive visual library for JavaScript. Right around the beginning of bootcamp, I started learning P5 to brush up on my JavaScript skills, and since then it's been great practice to continue to play around with it. I see a lot of potential in using it as I have in my header- small elements of visual flair that are unique on each render, that keep a webpage fresh each time you see it. In a modern web that's constantly becoming more dynamic, more immersive, and more emotive, I think this provides a great path for engaging front-end design.
