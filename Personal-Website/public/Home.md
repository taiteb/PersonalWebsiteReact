## Welcome to my website! 

I'm a 25 year old full-stack web developer, having enrolled and (soon to be) graduated from FullStack academy, in partnership with Colorado State University. I appreciate your interest in my work, and I hope this serves as a showcase for my abilities. This site is built by me, from the ground up. 

For a more detailed bio, click the About tab above. Portfolio is where I've got my most substantial projects, and I'll be updating it as I continue to work. To get in touch, please fill out the Contact form above. Finally, Recent Projects contains smaller projects, mostly P5.js sketches I've been doing.
