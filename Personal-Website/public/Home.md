This portfolio site is built off React JS, deployed through Netlify, with WordPress acting as a headless CMS so that sections can be easily updated. No pre-built templates or UI components have been used for the front end. Since WordPress returns posts as renderable HTML, I've sanitized what the API returns before directly rendering it just in case, and for future-proofing.  

The banner up above is an iFrame embed of a P5.js script I wrote, hosted from GitHub Sites. Right around the beginning of bootcamp, I started learning P5 to brush up on my JavaScript skills, and since then it's been great practice to continue to play around with it. I see a lot of potential in using it as I have in my header- small elements of visual flair that are unique on each render, that keep a webpage fresh each time you see it. In a modern web that's constantly becoming more dynamic, more immersive, and more emotive, I think this provides a great path for engaging front-end design.
